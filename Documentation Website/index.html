        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Today, I am creating this JavaScript tutorial to provide you with a
            resource that will help you learn JavaScript. Also, you can use this
            tutorial as a reference later to lookup various concepts and code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine a website as a house. HTML is like the bricks and walls that
            give it structure. CSS is like the paint and decorations that make
            it look nice. But without JavaScript, the house won't have any
            lights or running water—nothing would work or move.

              t is a way to talk to computers. A language like Hindi, English,
              or Bengali can be used to talk to a human but for computers, we
              need straightforward instructions.
            </li>

              Programming is the act of constructing a program, a set of precise
              instructions telling a computer what to do. Programming is the
              process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining
              the source code of computer programs.
            </li>
            <h2>What is ECMAScript?</h2>
            <li>ECMAScript is a standard on which JavaScript is based!</li>

            <li>
              It was created to ensure that different documents on JavaScript
              are talking about the same language.
            </li>

            <h2>ECMAScript Versions:</h2>
            <li>
              Beginning in 1997, JavaScript has evolved into many versions.
              ECMAScript1 or ES1 was first released in 1997. <li>ECMAScript 2015
              also known as ES6 was released in 2015 and a major revision to
              JavaScript was made.</li>
              <li>The latest version of JavaScript will be
              ECMaScript2022 (ES13) in 2022. What is JavaScript?</li>

                  console.log("x is not greater than 5");
